Using these modded json files and instructions could break the functioning of your DAYZ server, requiring a reinstall that would wipe
all player progress.

Using these modded files neccessitates increased regular restarts to prevent server crashing.

It is suggested you thoroughly test your server after applying these files to ensure proper
functioning of your server.

I always recomend you validate your files at: https://www.xmlvalidation.com/ and https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/

Copy all of the objects and then paste them onto the map where you please, adjusting their angle / altitude to suit.
